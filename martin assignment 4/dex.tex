\section{Introduction}
Android Wear is a version of Google's Android operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearables\cite{one}. By pairing with mobile phones running Android version 4.3 or newer, or iOS version 8.2 or newer with limited support from Google's pairing application, Android Wear integrates Google Assistant technology and mobile notifications into a smartwatch form factor. It also adds the ability to download applications from the Google Play Store\cite{one}.
\section{Features of android wears}
Options include a screen always on feature and a "tilt to wake screen" setting to light the screen automatically\cite{four}.
Users can find directions by voice from the phone, choose transport mode, including bike, and start a journey. While traveling, the watch shows directions, and vibrates to indicate turns by feel.Android Wear supports Bluetooth\cite{ten}, Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE connectivity, as well as a range of features and applications. Watch face styles include round, square and rectangular\cite{nine}
\section{Notifications}
The vibration engine alerts users about important notifications originating from a user-selectable set of applications. Wear provides multiple options for replying, including Google Voice Typing for dictating responses to messages\cite{one}, and spoken or drawn emoticons.
Intelligent notifications from Google Now are supported including traffic, flights, hotel check-in, meeting alerts, location- and time-based reminders, weather and sport, stocks, flight status, boarding passes, restaurant bookings
